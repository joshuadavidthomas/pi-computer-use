# Usage

This guide describes how to use `pi-computer-use` tools from Pi once the extension is installed and macOS permissions are granted.

## Core Workflow

Call `screenshot` first when you already know the target. It selects the controlled window and returns the latest semantic state.

```ts
screenshot()
screenshot({ app: "Safari" })
screenshot({ app: "TextEdit", windowTitle: "Untitled" })
```

When the app or window is ambiguous, discover targets first:

```ts
list_apps()
list_windows({ app: "Safari" })
screenshot({ window: "@w1" })
```

Action tools operate on the current controlled window by default. To switch windows, call `screenshot` again with an app/window title or a `window` ref from `list_windows`. You can also pass `window` to action tools when you want to make the intended target explicit:

```ts
click({ window: "@w1", ref: "@e1" })
keypress({ window: "@w1", keys: ["Enter"] })
```

Tool results include:

- `target`: app, bundle ID, pid, window title, and window ID.
- `capture`: screenshot dimensions, scale factor, capture ID, and coordinate space.
- `axTargets`: semantic targets such as `@e1`.
- `execution`: strategy, variant, AX/fallback details, and strict-mode compatibility.
- Optional image content when semantic coverage is weak or fallback recovery is useful.

## AX Refs First

When the latest state includes AX refs, prefer them over coordinates.

```ts
click({ ref: "@e1" })
set_text({ ref: "@e2", text: "hello" })
scroll({ ref: "@e3", scrollY: 600 })
```

Refs are intentionally short and local to the latest semantic state. If a ref is stale, the bridge tries to reacquire a matching target by role, label, capabilities, and position.

Use coordinates only when no matching AX target is available:

```ts
click({ x: 320, y: 180, captureId: "..." })
```

Coordinates are window-relative screenshot pixels from the latest screenshot.

## Tool Reference

| Tool | Purpose | Prefer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_apps` | Discover running apps | Before targeting when app names are unknown or ambiguous |
| `list_windows` | Discover controllable windows, ids, titles, and geometry | Before targeting multi-window apps |
| `screenshot` | Select or refresh the controlled window | `window` refs or app/window filters when switching target |
| `click` | Activate by AX ref or coordinate | `ref` |
| `double_click` | Open/select items that require double-click | `ref` when available |
| `move_mouse` | Trigger hover behavior | Coordinates |
| `drag` | Drag path or AX adjust target | `ref` plus path for adjustable controls |
| `scroll` | Scroll by AX ref or coordinate | `ref` |
| `keypress` | Enter, Escape, Tab, arrows, deletion, shortcuts | Semantic keys when possible |
| `type_text` | Insert text at current cursor/selection | Use after focusing field |
| `set_text` | Replace AX text value | `ref` with `canSetValue` |
| `wait` | Pause and refresh state | Polling/loading states |
| `computer_actions` | Batch obvious actions | Use only when intermediate inspection is unnecessary |

## Text Input

Use `set_text` when replacement semantics are correct:

```ts
set_text({ ref: "@e2", text: "new value" })
```

Use `click` plus `type_text` when insertion semantics matter:

```ts
click({ ref: "@e2" })
type_text({ text: " inserted text" })
```

Use `keypress` for non-text keys:

```ts
keypress({ keys: ["Enter"] })
keypress({ keys: ["Command+L"] })
keypress({ keys: ["Tab", "Enter"] })
```

For shortcut sequences, use chord strings such as `Command+L`. Use arrays like `["Command", "L"]` only for a single chord call.

## Browser Workflows

For browser work, prefer a dedicated browser window rather than the user's active tab. The extension tries to open an isolated browser window when safe and appropriate.

Common address-field workflow:

```ts
computer_actions({
  captureId: "...",
  actions: [
    { type: "keypress", keys: ["Command+L"] },
    { type: "type_text", text: "https://example.com" },
    { type: "keypress", keys: ["Enter"] }
  ]
})
```

For Safari and Chromium-family browsers, this can use an AX-first path for address replacement and navigation.

If `browser_use` is disabled, browser screenshots and actions are refused. See [configuration](./configuration.md).

## Batching

`computer_actions` accepts one to twenty actions and returns one post-action state update.

Good fit:

```ts
computer_actions({
  captureId: "...",
  actions: [
    { type: "click", ref: "@e1" },
    { type: "set_text", ref: "@e2", text: "hello" },
    { type: "keypress", keys: ["Enter"] }
  ]
})
```

Do not batch when the next action depends on seeing the intermediate result.

Each batched action includes execution metadata, including whether it used the `stealth` or `default` variant.

## Strict AX Mode

Strict AX mode requires background-safe Accessibility paths.

Allowed when AX support is available:

- AX press/focus
- AX value replacement
- AX scroll
- AX increment/decrement adjustment
- Semantic key actions such as confirm/cancel/press

Blocked:

- Raw pointer events
- Raw keyboard events
- Foreground focus fallbacks
- Cursor takeover
- Browser window bootstrap that requires non-AX automation

Enable strict AX mode with config or environment variables. See [configuration](./configuration.md).
