Add Codex-style computer-use tools to Pi on macOS.

This package bundles:
- a Pi extension that adds semantic computer-use tools
- a skill that teaches the agent how to use those tools reliably
- a native macOS helper used for screenshots and AX dispatch

## What you get

Public tools:
- `screenshot`
- `click`
- `type_text`
- `wait`

`screenshot` includes compact AX targets when available, and `click` can use either an AX ref like `@e1` or screenshot coordinates. AX refs are preferred whenever a suitable target is listed, and images are attached only when semantic AX targeting is insufficient or too ambiguous.

Default mode has built-in screenshot/vision grounding and uses AX-first actions with compatibility fallback when semantic AX control is not enough.

## Release notes

### v0.1.3

- Added compact AX target refs in tool results and direct semantic targeting through `click({ ref: "@eN" })`
- Switched to semantic-first turn updates with image attachment fallback only when AX coverage is weak or ambiguous
- Added an official contributor benchmark in `benchmarks/` with saved baselines, regression checks, and explicit goals
- Improved AX extraction quality and reduced end-to-end latency substantially in benchmarked flows
- Current benchmark goals pass with observed results including:
  - `axOnlyRatio = 1.0`
  - `avgLatencyMs = 404`
  - `avgTargetingLatencyMs = 378`

### v0.1.2

- Browser computer use now prefers creating a new window instead of reusing the user's current browser window/tab context
- When an isolated browser window is created, pi-computer-use automatically switches focus back to the user's original window
- During the brief window-switch transition, pi-computer-use temporarily suppresses input to prevent accidental typing/clicking in the wrong window

Opt-in stealth mode (`PI_COMPUTER_USE_STEALTH=1` or `PI_COMPUTER_USE_STRICT_AX=1`) keeps the same public surface, but blocks non-AX fallback paths and stays AX-only.

## Requirements

- macOS 15+
- Pi / `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`
- Node.js 20.6+
- Accessibility and Screen Recording permission for the helper binary

## Install

`pi-computer-use` currently resolves to an unrelated package. Install this package from GitHub or a local checkout instead.

### Global install

```bash
pi install git:github.com/injaneity/pi-computer-use
```

### Project-local install

```bash
pi install -l git:github.com/injaneity/pi-computer-use
```

### Install from a local checkout

```bash
pi install /absolute/path/to/pi-computer-use
# or
pi install -l /absolute/path/to/pi-computer-use
```

This follows the standard Pi package install flow used by other Pi packages.

### Local development without duplicate loads

If you already have `pi-computer-use` installed globally or locally through `pi install`, running a checkout directly with `pi -e .` can load both copies at once. For local development, either remove the installed copy first or disable extension discovery for that run:

```bash
pi --no-extensions -e .
```

## What happens after install

- Pi loads the extension from `extensions/`
- Pi loads the skill from `skills/`
- the helper is installed to:

```text
~/.pi/agent/helpers/pi-computer-use/bridge
```

The package tries to copy a bundled prebuilt helper during `postinstall`. If a matching prebuilt is not available, the runtime can build one locally on first use.

## First run / required setup

Start Pi in interactive mode.

On session start, the extension performs a one-time computer-use setup check automatically. If permissions are missing, Pi surfaces that immediately and walks you through setup inline instead of failing later during tool use.

If permissions are missing, the extension will guide you through granting:
- Accessibility
- Screen Recording

Permissions required:
- Screen Recording: lets the agent see the target window and provides screenshot/vision context
- Accessibility: lets the agent click, focus, and type in the target window

Normally you do not need any additional permission beyond those two.

If you cancel setup, pi-computer-use stays unavailable until setup is completed.

Grant both permissions to the helper at:

```text
~/.pi/agent/helpers/pi-computer-use/bridge
```

## Example prompts

- `Use the computer-use tools to inspect the frontmost window.`
- `Take a screenshot of the current window and click the Continue button.`
- `Switch to Safari, open the current tab area, and report what you see.`

## Notes

- Target platform: macOS only
- `screenshot` should be called first to choose a target window
- Browser targeting prefers an isolated browser window instead of reusing the user's current tabbed window
- When an isolated browser window is created, focus is restored to the user's original window immediately afterward
- During the brief restore/switch phase, input is temporarily suppressed to prevent accidental input in the wrong window
- In strict AX mode, isolated browser-window bootstrap is blocked because it is not AX-only; open a dedicated browser window first
- Successful actions return the latest semantic state for the next step; images are attached only when semantic AX targeting is insufficient or too ambiguous
- The helper uses a non-intrusive strategy where possible instead of taking over your cursor globally
- Accessibility is mandatory for practical use: actions depend on it
- Screen Recording is mandatory for screenshots and model vision context
- Public tool surface is `screenshot`, `click`, `type_text`, `wait`
- Default mode has built-in screenshot/vision grounding and runs AX-first, with non-AX fallback when a control cannot be completed semantically
- Opt-in stealth mode blocks fallback paths and keeps actions on AX-only semantic paths
- Tool results include execution metadata so we can verify whether an action used AX or a fallback path
- Stealth mode remains on the current desktop/session only: no second screen or virtual display, no foreground activation, and no physical cursor takeover

## Official QA benchmark

Use the official benchmark harness in `benchmarks/` before claiming semantic-targeting, fallback, or latency improvements.

```bash
npm run benchmark:qa
# or for wider app coverage
npm run benchmark:qa:full
```

See `benchmarks/README.md` for baseline comparison and regression checking.

## Build the helper manually

If you need to build the helper yourself:

```bash
node scripts/build-native.mjs
```

You can also build to a custom output path:

```bash
node scripts/build-native.mjs --output ~/.pi/agent/helpers/pi-computer-use/bridge
```

## Remove

```bash
pi remove git:github.com/injaneity/pi-computer-use
```
